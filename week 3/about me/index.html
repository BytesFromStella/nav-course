    Born in Finnmark, raised in Northern-Troms and since 2018 been living "down south"!
    Because what else am I supposed to do up there? Stare at the mountains? I wanna meet people and experience things!
    Yes, that means I'm not an outdoor person per say, but I'm also not anti-social. I love meeting people, especially over the internet.

    <p>
        My name is Stella (hopefully legally too, soon). I'm a Norwegian trans girl who loves to experience things and people.
        This NAV course has really revitalized my coding skills and with the use of chatGPT I never need to get stuck on
        any problems just because I don't wanna spend 45 min figuring out the correct syntax and having to scroll through 
        5 pages of documentation just to write one line.

        "Using chatGPT is cheating and you don't learn anything!"
        If you think it's a tool for cheating you're quite wrong! I'm not copy-pasting code like a robot. 
        Like any tool, if you abuse it and make it do your job... you're not really learning anything. You have to treat it like a book.
        When you went to school, you would get lectured about plagarism if you didn't formulate sentences and facts with your
        own words. This is the same kind of concept!
